# How to use it?

1. visit http://www.exploreyourdata.com/tiles ,login with Twitter.  
2. Create a task  
3. Choose what's the next step for this task: either you need to advance the task, or you are waiting for somebody else (or something to happen) before the task can continue.  
4. Tasks in reddish need your action, those in bright yellow are paused, waiting for somebody / something to progress. You see at a glance what needs your attention.  
5. Click on the cross to delete a task permanently  
6. Leave the app. Your tasks will be there for you when you will revisit http://www.exploreyourdata.com/tiles

This app was coded in Java with JSF and Primefaces, with MLabs for Mongo hosting. It needs some serious CSS work. Anybody wants to contribute? Ping me at @seinecle on Twitter.
